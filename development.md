# PostCardIt - Development Documentation for Claude Code

## Project Overview

PostCardIt is an iOS application that allows users to create and send digital postcards. Built with SwiftUI and integrated with AWS services for authentication and storage.

**Key Features:**
- User authentication via AWS Cognito
- Digital postcard creation with custom images
- Photo library integration
- Tab-based navigation with custom tab bar
- User profile management
- Map integration for location-based features

## Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Platform**: iOS 14.0+
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito Identity Provider
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for image storage
- **Dependencies**: CocoaPods (AWS SDK)
- **Testing**: Swift Testing + XCTest UI Testing

```

## Key Components

### App Flow
1. **Splash Screen** (2-second delay)
2. **Authentication Check** â†’ Login or Main App
3. **Main Tab Navigation** with custom tab bar

### Services
- **CognitoAuthService**: Handles user registration, login, password reset
- **PostcardService**: Manages postcard creation, image upload to S3

### Views Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModels as ObservableObject services
- **Environment Objects**: Shared auth service across views
- **State Management**: @State, @StateObject, @Binding patterns

## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pod install

# Open workspace (important: use .xcworkspace not .xcodeproj)
open PostCardIt.xcworkspace

# Build project
xcodebuild -workspace PostCardIt.xcworkspace -scheme PostCardIt build

# Run tests
xcodebuild test -workspace PostCardIt.xcworkspace -scheme PostCardIt -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### AWS Configuration
- Configure AWS credentials in `CognitoAuthService.swift`
- Set up Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool
- Configure S3 bucket for image storage

## Code Conventions

### Naming
- Use camelCase for variables/functions
- Use PascalCase for types/classes
- Descriptive names: `selectedImage` not `img`
- Boolean prefixes: `is`, `has`, `should`

### SwiftUI Patterns
- `@StateObject` for view-owned ObservableObjects
- `@EnvironmentObject` for shared services
- Extract complex views into separate components
- Use computed properties for simple view logic

### File Organization
- Group related views in folders
- One main type per file
- Use MARK comments for sections

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (`PostCardItTests/`)
- Framework: Swift Testing (modern approach)
- Test models, services, business logic

### UI Tests (`PostCardItUITests/`)
- Framework: XCTest UI Testing
- Test user flows, navigation, authentication

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features
- âœ… User authentication (login, registration, password reset)
- âœ… Custom tab bar navigation
- âœ… Basic UI structure for all main screens
- âœ… AWS Cognito integration
- âœ… Image picker integration
- âœ… Splash screen with app branding

### In Development
- ðŸš§ Backend API integration (placeholder methods exist)
- ðŸš§ Postcard creation workflow
- ðŸš§ Map functionality
- ðŸš§ Profile management features

### Known Technical Debt
- Remove commented-out code in CreatePostcardView
- Implement proper error states throughout app
- Add comprehensive unit test coverage
- Consider migrating to async/await patterns

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Issues
- Always use `.xcworkspace` file, not `.xcodeproj`
- Run `pod install` after pulling changes
- Check AWS SDK compatibility with iOS version

### Development Tips
- Use iOS Simulator iPhone 15 for testing
- Check Info.plist permissions for photo library access
- Monitor memory usage during image operations
- Test authentication flows thoroughly

## Security Considerations

- AWS Cognito handles password security
- Never log sensitive user information
- Use HTTPS for all network requests
- Implement proper session management
- Handle photo library permissions gracefully

**For Claude Code**: This is a SwiftUI iOS app with AWS backend integration. Use the existing patterns and services when making modifications. Always test authentication flows and image handling features when making changes.
